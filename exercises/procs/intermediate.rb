# 1. Define a proc that takes two arguments and returns their product


# 2. Define a proc that takes one argument and returns its square root


# 3. Define a proc that takes no arguments and returns the current time


# 4. Define a proc that takes a variable number of arguments and returns the maximum value


# 5. Use the `curry` method to create a new proc that takes one argument and returns the result of calling the original proc with both arguments set to that value


# 6. Call the new proc with the argument 5 and assign the result to a variable
  # should print 25

# 7. Use the `lambda?` method to check if a proc is a lambda
  # should print "false"
  # should print "false"
  # should print "false"

# 8. Use the `binding` method to get the binding of a proc


# 9. Use the `eval` method to evaluate a string of code in the context of the proc's binding

  # should print 4

# 10. Use the `source_location` method to get the file and line number where a proc was defined
  # should print the file and line number where the proc was defined
