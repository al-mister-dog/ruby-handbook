# 1. Define an array of integers called `numbers`
numbers = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]

# 2. Use the `sort` method to sort the array in ascending order


# 3. Use the `select` method to create a new array that only includes even numbers
even_numbers = numbers.select { |number| number % 2 == 0 }

# 4. Use the `reject` method to create a new array that excludes even numbers
odd_numbers = numbers.reject { |n| n % 2 == 0 }

# 5. Use the `uniq` method to create a new array with duplicate elements removed


# 6. Use the `join` method to convert the array to a string with the elements separated by a comma


# 7. Choose a random element from the array
 # should print a random element from the array


# 8. Shuffle the elements of the array in a random order


# 9. Use the `cycle` method to iterate over the elements of the array indefinitely
# stop after the first element

# 10. Use the `zip` method to create a new array by combining elements from two arrays
