# 1. Define an array of strings called `words`
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# 2. find the element of the string "banana" in the array

# 3. find the index of the string "date" in the array
# If the element is not found, return the index where it would be inserted


# 4. group the elements of the array into subarrays based on a condition

  # should print [[5, ["apple"]], [6, ["banana", "cherry"]], [4, ["date"]]]

# 5. generate all possible combinations of two elements from the array

# should print [["apple", "banana"], ["apple", "cherry"], ["banana", "cherry"]]
